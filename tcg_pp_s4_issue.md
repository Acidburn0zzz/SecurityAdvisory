# 21. TCG PP S4 issue



## Description:


TCG physical presence will record TCG PP flag (if user confirmation is required) to a variable ```(TCG2_PHYSICAL_PRESENCE_FLAGS_VARIABLE/gEfiTcg2PhysicalPresenceGuid)```. This variable is locked by ```EDKII_VARIABLE_LOCK_PROTOCOL```.
In S4 resume path, the code ```Tcg2PhysicalPresenceLibProcessRequest``` finds it is S4 resume and return immediately. It does not call ```EDKII_VARIABLE_LOCK_PROTOCOL``` to lock the variable ```(TCG2_PHYSICAL_PRESENCE_FLAGS_VARIABLE/ gEfiTcg2PhysicalPresenceGuid)```.


## Recommendation:


We need update ```Tcg2PhysicalPresenceLibProcessRequest``` to move S4 check AFTER variable lock.
